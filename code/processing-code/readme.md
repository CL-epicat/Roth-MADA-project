This folder contains code for processing data.

It's the same code done 3 times:

* First, there is an R script that you can run which does all the cleaning. `processingcode.R`
* Second, there is a Quarto file which contains exactly the same code as the R script. `processingfile-v1.qmd`
* Third,  is a Quarto file with an approach where the code is pulled in from the R script and run. `processingfile-v2.qmd`

Please note I do not know if I did `processingfile-v2.qmd` correctly, so please use `processingfile-v1.qmd` as the master.
