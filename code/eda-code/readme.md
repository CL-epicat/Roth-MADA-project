This folder contains code for simple exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the processed/cleaned data. The code produces a few tables and figures, which are saved in the appropriate `results` sub-folder. All final files will have a _final in the name. Extra code written for creating summary tables is included at the end of the documents to preserve the learning process. This code should not be run.

It's the same code done 2 times:

* First, there is a Quarto file which contains exactly the same code as the R script. `eda-v1.qmd`

* Second, there is an R script that you can run which does all the cleaning. `edacode.R`

If you find any discrepancy between .qmd and .R documents, please run the .qmd documents. Please also notify me, so I can fix these mistakes.
