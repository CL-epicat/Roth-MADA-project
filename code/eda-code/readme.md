This folder contains code for simple exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the processed/cleaned data. The code produces a few tables and figures, which are saved in the appropriate `results` sub-folder. All final files will have a _final in the name. Extra code written for creating summary tables is included in a supplemental `.R` script, `edacode-extra.R`. This code should not be run, but is relevant to my learning process.

It's the same code done 2 times:

* First, there is a Quarto file which contains exactly the same code as the R script. `eda-v1.qmd`. Please run the `.qmd` file rather than the `.R` file.

* Second, there is an R script with the same code titled `edacode.R`. This is the same code as in the `.qmd` file, but in a different format.

If you find any discrepancy between `.qmd` and `.R` documents, please also notify me, so I can fix these mistakes.
