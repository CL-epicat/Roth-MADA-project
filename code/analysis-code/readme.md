This folder contains code for analysis on the processed/cleaned data.

The code produces a few tables and figures, which are saved in the `results` folder. All final files will have a _final in the name

It's the same code done 2 times:

* First, there is a Quarto file which contains exactly the same code as the R script. `introanalyis-v1.qmd`

* Second, there is an R script that you can run which does all the cleaning. `introanalysis.R`

If you find any discrepancy between .qmd and .R documents, please run the .qmd documents. Please also notify me, so I can fix these mistakes.
