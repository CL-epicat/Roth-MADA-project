This folder contains code for analysis on the processed/cleaned data.

The code produces a few tables and figures, which are saved in the `results` folder. All final files will have a _final in the name

There are two sets of code done 2 times:

`Introanalysis-v1`
1. First, there is a Quarto file which contains exactly the same code as the R script. `introanalyis-v1.qmd`
2. Second, there is an R script that you can run which does all the cleaning. `introanalysis.R`

`Fullanalysis-v1`
1. First, there is a Quarto file which contains exactly the same code as the R script. `fullanalyis-v1.qmd`
2. Second, there is an R script that you can run which does all the cleaning. `fullanalysis.R`

The quarto files are the master files, so please run them if possible. If you find any discrepancy between `.qmd` and `.R` files, please run the `.qmd` files. Please also notify me, so I can fix these mistakes.
