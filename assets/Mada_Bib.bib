  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Newborn weight may vary between ethnic groups, but it is not known if birthweight differences exist between term babies born to immigrant mothers compared with those born in their corresponding native countries. METHODS: We completed a systematic review of all birthweight curves published between 1980 and 2012, based on at least 100 singleton deliveries. We compared the 10th, 50th and 90th percentile birthweight values at 40 weeks gestation for male and female infants born in their native country vs. those infants born to mothers who had emigrated from their native country to Ontario, Canada. For the 50th percentile values, we also calculated a standardised pooled weighted difference and 95\% confidence interval [CI] for both sexes. We also assessed whether birthweight differed over time, or if the differences varied by the Human Development Index (HDI) value for the native country. RESULTS: A total of 31 studies from 21 different countries met the inclusion criteria, comprising 13\,317\,578 males and 12\,859\,119 females born at 40 weeks gestation. There was a small non-significant rise in reported birthweight percentile values between 1983 and 2006. Nearly all infants born to women in their native country had lower birthweights than those born to mothers who had emigrated from the same country to Canada at the 10th, 50th and 90th percentiles. Overall, the 50th percentile weights differed by 115 g [95\% CI 74, 156] for males and 122 g [95\% CI 95, 150] for females. As HDI or median birthweight increased, birthweight differences were less pronounced, but not significantly so. CONCLUSIONS: Term birthweight percentiles are typically higher among term infants born to mother who immigrate to Canada than those of infants born in their respective native country.},

  abstract = {In 2017-2019, the March of Dimes convened a workgroup with biomedical, clinical, and epidemiologic expertise to review knowledge of the causes of the persistent Black-White disparity in preterm birth (PTB). Multiple databases were searched to identify hypothesized causes examined in peer-reviewed literature, 33 hypothesized causes were reviewed for whether they plausibly affect PTB and either occur more/less frequently and/or have a larger/smaller effect size among Black women vs. White women. While definitive proof is lacking for most potential causes, most are biologically plausible. No single downstream or midstream factor explains the disparity or its social patterning, however, many likely play limited roles, e.g., while genetic factors likely contribute to PTB, they explain at most a small fraction of the disparity. Research links most hypothesized midstream causes, including socioeconomic factors and stress, with the disparity through their influence on the hypothesized downstream factors. Socioeconomic factors alone cannot explain the disparity's social patterning. Chronic stress could affect PTB through neuroendocrine and immune mechanisms leading to inflammation and immune dysfunction, stress could alter a woman's microbiota, immune response to infection, chronic disease risks, and behaviors, and trigger epigenetic changes influencing PTB risk. As an upstream factor, racism in multiple forms has repeatedly been linked with the plausible midstream/downstream factors, including socioeconomic disadvantage, stress, and toxic exposures. Racism is the only factor identified that directly or indirectly could explain the racial disparities in the plausible midstream/downstream causes and the observed social patterning. Historical and contemporary systemic racism can explain the racial disparities in socioeconomic opportunities that differentially expose African Americans to lifelong financial stress and associated health-harming conditions. Segregation places Black women in stressful surroundings and exposes them to environmental hazards. Race-based discriminatory treatment is a pervasive stressor for Black women of all socioeconomic levels, considering both incidents and the constant vigilance needed to prepare oneself for potential incidents. Racism is a highly plausible, major upstream contributor to the Black-White disparity in PTB through multiple pathways and biological mechanisms. While much is unknown, existing knowledge and core values (equity, justice) support addressing racism in efforts to eliminate the racial disparity in PTB.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: This study explores whether nativity differences in health care and sociodemographic factors help to account for nativity differences in low birth weight (LBW) when comparing US-born Black women (USBW) to Black Immigrant women (BIW). METHODS: Bivariate analyses and multinomial nested logit (MNL) models were performed using the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) dataset. RESULTS: Statistically significant nativity differences between USBW and BIW were found across variables of LBW (p\,=\,.009), marital status (p\,{$<$}\,.001), education level (p\,{$<$}\,.001), receiving public assistance (p\,{$<$}\,.001), health care coverage (p\,{$<$}\,.001), age (p\,{$<$}\,.001), and poverty level income (p\,{$<$}\,.001). Results from the MNL models indicated that BIW were 91\% less likely to have a LBW baby (p\,{$<$}\,.001). When accounting for other sociodemographic and health care related variables differing by nativity, although a statistically significant, narrowing gap between BIW and USBW was observed (OR\,=\,.12, p\,{$<$}\,.001), BIW were still less likely to have a LBW baby. CONCLUSIONS: Differences between USBW and BIW across sociodemographic variables and health care related factors related to adverse pregnancy outcomes were observed in this study. Controlling for the factors attenuated nativity differences but did not eliminate the differences on LBW. Future research should continue to explore this relationship.},

METHODS: A systematic review was conducted using searches in two online databases, PubMed and Literature in the Health Sciences in Latin America and the Caribbean (LILACS). The searches covered materials published between 1 January 1982 and 5 May 2016. The search terms used were ("infant, premature" OR "infant, small for gestational age" OR "fetal growth retardation") AND ("socioeconomic factors" OR "ethnic groups" OR "maternal age"). RESULTS: A total of 3 070 references that met the initial selection criteria were analyzed, and 157 relevant studies were fully read. We located 18 studies that investigated associations of family or maternal income, education, or ethnicity with low birthweight, small-for-gestational-age birth, or preterm birth. Of the 18, 10 of them involved high-income countries, and 8 dealt with middle- or low-income countries. Greater evidence was found for an association between ethnicity and the three outcomes studied, particularly for prematurity among children of black mothers. There was little evidence for an association between maternal/family income or education and any of the three outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Income and education weren't determinants for low birthweight, small-for-gestational-age birth, or preterm birth. However, black ethnicity was strongly associated with the three outcomes, especially with prematurity.},

  abstract = {Trends in human welfare in Brazil have remained shrouded by a dearth of historical evidence. Although quantitative scholars have revealed the efficacy of the First Republic (1889--1930) in fomenting economic progress, the extent to which Brazil's early economic growth fostered improvements in health remains unclear. This paper fills this void in scholarship by relying on hitherto untapped archival sources with data on human stature---a reliable metric for health and nutritional status. My analysis centres heavily on a large (n {$\approx$} 16,000), geographically-comprehensive series compiled from military inscription files, supplemented by an ancillary dataset drawn from passport records (n {$\approx$} 6,000). I document inferior heights in the North and Northeast that predated the advent of industrialisation. At the national level, my findings reveal an increase in stature of over 2.5 cm between soldiers born in the 1880s and those born in the 1910s. In the South and Southeast, I argue that increased real income and public-health interventions explain the earlier upward trend in heights, while rural sanitary reforms were most important in the North and Northeast, where heights remained stagnant until the 1910 decade and diseases such as hookworm and malaria were most rampant., Las tendencias en el bienestar humano en Brasil no han sido estudiadas por una escasez de evidencia hist{\'o}rica. Los estudios cuantitativos muestran la eficacia de la Primera Rep{\'u}blica (1889--1930) para fomentar el progreso econ{\'o}mico, pero no queda claro hasta qu{\'e} punto el crecimiento econ{\'o}mico inicial de Brasil gener{\'o} mejoras en la salud.

Mi an{\'a}lisis se centra en una gran serie (n {$\approx$} 16,000), geogr{\'a}ficamente integral, compilada a partir de archivos de inscripci{\'o}n militares, complementada por un conjunto de datos auxiliares extra{\'i}dos de registros de pasaportes (n {$\approx$} 6,000). Se documentan estaturas inferiores en el norte y el noreste que precedieron el advenimiento de la industrialisaci{\'o}n. Al nivel nacional, mis hallazgos revelan un aumento en la estatura de m{\'a}s de 2,5 cm entre los soldados nacidos en la d{\'e}cada de 1880 y los nacidos en la d{\'e}cada de 1910. En el sur y el sureste, el aumento de ingresos reales y las intervenciones de salud p{\'u}blica explican la tendencia alcista en las estaturas, mientras que las reformas sanitarias rurales fueron m{\'a}s importantes en el norte y el noreste, donde las estaturas permanecieron estancadas hasta la d{\'e}cada de 1910 y las enfermedades como la anquilostomiasis y la malaria eran m{\'a}s generalisadas.},

  abstract = {After more than a century of research and debate, the scientific community has yet to reach agreement on the principal causes of racialized disparities in population health. This debate currently centers on the degree to which "race residuals" are a result of unobserved differences in the social context or unobserved differences in population characteristics. The comparative study of native and foreign-born Black populations represents a quasi-experimental design where race is "held constant". Such studies present a unique opportunity to improve our understanding of the social determinants of population health disparities. Since native and foreign-born Black populations occupy different sociocultural locations, and since populations with greater African ancestry have greater genetic diversity, comparative studies of these populations will advance our understanding of the complex relationship between sociocultural context, population characteristics and health outcomes. Therefore, we offer a conceptual framing for the comparative study of native and foreign-born Blacks along with a review of 208 studies that compare the mental and physical health of these populations. Although there is some complexity, especially with respect to mental health, the overall pattern is that foreign-born Blacks have better health outcomes than native-born Blacks. After reviewing these studies, we conclude with suggestions for future studies in this promising area of social and medical research.},

Infants with a black mother and father have the lowest mean birthweights, while infants with two white parents have the highest weights. Newborns with mixed-race parents have intermediate birthweight distributions. Multivariate analysis suggests that the effects of parental race on birthweight are not the result of maternal/obstetric differences among parents of the same or mixed race.},

STUDY DESIGN: The study comprised all singleton live births to Black women in California between 2011 and 2017. We defined maternal nativity as US-born or foreign-born. Using Poisson regression, we computed risk ratios (RR) and 95\% confidence intervals (CI) for three adverse perinatal outcomes: preterm birth, small for gestational age deliveries, and infant mortality. RESULTS: Rates of adverse perinatal outcomes were significantly higher among US-born Black women. In adjusted models, US-born Black women experienced an increased risk of preterm birth (RR 1.51, 95\% CI 1.39, 1.65) and small for gestational age deliveries (RR 1.52, 95\% CI 1.41, 1.64), compared to foreign-born Black women. CONCLUSIONS: Future studies should consider experiences of racism across the life course when exploring heterogeneity in the risk of adverse perinatal outcomes by nativity among Black women in the US.},

However, researchers have also documented significant variability in this immigrant birth paradox when examining within and across racial and ethnic subgroups. This review paper summarizes fifty years of research regarding differences in low, preterm birth, and infant mortality in the US, according to the nativity status of the birthing person. While there is ample evidence of the importance of nativity in delineating a pregnant person's risk of adverse infant outcomes, this review also highlights the relative paucity of research exploring the intersection of acculturation, ethnic enclaves, and structural segregation. We also provide recommendations for advancing the study of perinatal outcomes among immigrants.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Understanding current levels, as well as past and future trends, of the percentage of infants born at low birthweight (LBW) in the United States is imperative to improving the health of our nation. The purpose of this study, therefore, was to examine recent trends in percentage of LBW, both overall and by maternal race and education subgroups. Studying disparities in percentage of LBW by these subgroups can help to further understand the health needs of the population and can inform policies that can close race and class disparities in poor birth outcomes. METHODS: Trends of percentage of LBW in the U.S. from 2003 to 2018, both overall and by race/ethnicity, and from 2007 to 2018 by education and race by education subgroups were analyzed using CDC WONDER Natality data. Disparities were analyzed using between group variance methods. RESULTS: Percentage of LBW experienced a significant worsening in the most recent 5\,years of data, negating nearly a decade of prior improvement. Stark differences were observed by race/ethnicity and by education, with all subgroups experiencing increasing rates in recent years. Disparities also worsened over the course of study. Most notably, all disparities increased significantly from 2014 to 2018, with annual changes near 2-5\%. CONCLUSIONS: Recent reversals in progress in percentage of LBW, as well as increasing disparities particularly by race, are troubling. Future study is needed to continue monitoring these trends and analyzing these issues at additional levels. Targets must be set and solutions must be tailored to population subgroups to effectively make progress towards equitable birth outcomes and maternal health.},

In the second half of the twentieth century, cesarean sections proliferated in clinical practice, but abortions remained illegal. Most importantly, women remained patients to be worked on rather than active participants in their reproductive lives.},

Regression-based analyses were performed to examine the individual and joint effects of genetic ancestry and stress (including lifetime stress [LS] and stress during pregnancy [PS]) on PTB and related traits among U.S. born and immigrant mothers.Significant associations between LS and PTB and related traits were found in the total study population and in immigrant mothers, including gestational age, birthweight, PTB, and spontaneous PTB; but no association was found in U.S. born mothers. Furthermore, significant joint associations of LS (or PS) and African ancestral proportion (AAP) on PTB were found in immigrant mothers, but not in U.S. born mothers.Although, overall, immigrant women had lower rates of PTB compared to U.S. born women, our study is one of the first to identify a subset of immigrant women could be at significantly increased risk of PTB and related outcomes if they have high AAP and are under high LS or PS. In light of the growing number of immigrant mothers in the U.S., our findings may have important clinical and public health implications.},

  abstract = {Background Low birth weight (LBW) newborns present different health outcomes when classified in different birth weight strata. This study evaluated the relationship of birth weight with Infant mortality (IM) through the influence of biological, social, and health care factors in a time series. Methods Retrospective cohort study with data collected from Information Systems (Live Births and Mortality). The mortality trends were performed for each birth weight stratum: extremely low, {$<$} 1000\,g; very low, 1000--1499\,g; low, 1500--2499\,g; insufficient, 2500--2999\,g; adequate, 3000--3900\,g; and macrosomia, {$>$} 4000\,g. Chi-square tests analyzed IM rates. Sequential Poisson regression analyzed the impact of the determinant factors. Results A total of 277,982 newborns were included in the study and 2088 died before their first year. There was a tendency for a decrease in mortality in all strata of weight. With the exception of macrosomics, all other strata had a higher risk for IM when compared with adequate birth weight. Extremely LBW newborns presented higher risk for mortality when born in a public hospital. A higher percentage of infant deaths were associated with lower maternal age and lower schooling for all strata. Prenatal care with less than three visits demonstrated a risk for IM in low, insufficient, and adequate birth weight strata. The cesarean section was a protective factor for IM in Extremely and Very LBW strata and it was a risk factor in adequate birth weight stratum. Conclusions LBW had a greater association with IM, especially those children of younger mothers and those born in public hospitals.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We examine disparities in birth weight and gestational age by ethnic ancestry in 2000-2011 in eight South American countries. METHODS: The sample included 60,480 singleton live births. Regression models were estimated to evaluate differences in birth outcomes by ethnic ancestry controlling for time trends. RESULTS: Significant disparities were found in seven countries. In four countries-Brazil, Ecuador, Uruguay, and Venezuela-we found significant disparities in both low birth weight and preterm birth. Disparities in preterm birth alone were observed in Argentina, Bolivia, and Colombia. Several differences in continuous birth weight, gestational age, and fetal growth rate were also observed. There were no systematic patterns of disparities between the evaluated ethnic ancestry groups across the study countries, in that no racial/ethnic group consistently had the best or worst outcomes in all countries. CONCLUSIONS: Racial/ethnic disparities in infant health are common in several South American countries. Differences across countries suggest that racial/ethnic disparities are driven by social and economic mechanisms. Researchers and policymakers should acknowledge these disparities and develop research and policy programs to effectively target them.},

  abstract = {Objective We investigate gradients (i.e. differences) in infant health outcomes by maternal education in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Venezuela and explore channels related to father's education, household labor outcomes, and maternal health, fertility, and use of prenatal services and technology. Methods We employ secondary interview and birth record data similarly collected across a network of birth hospitals from the early 1980s through 2011 within the Latin American Collaborative Study of Congenital Anomalies (ECLAMC). Focusing on children without birth defects, we estimate gradients in several infant health outcomes including birth weight, gestational age, and hospital discharge status by maternal education using ordinary least squares regression models adjusting for several demographic factors. To explore channels, we add as covariates father's education, parental occupational activity, maternal health and fertility history, and use of prenatal services and technology and evaluate changes in the coefficient of maternal education. We use the same models for each country sample. Results We find important differences in gradients across countries. We find evidence for educational gradients in preterm birth in three countries but weaker evidence for gradients in fetal growth. The extent to which observed household and maternal factors explain these gradients based on changes in the regression coefficient of maternal education when controlling for these factors as covariates also varies between countries. In contrast, we generally find evidence across all countries that higher maternal education is associated with increased use of prenatal care services and technology. Conclusions Our findings suggest that differences in infant health by maternal education and their underlying mechanisms vary and are not necessarily generalizable across countries. However, the positive association between maternal education and use of prenatal services and technology is more consistent across examined countries.},
